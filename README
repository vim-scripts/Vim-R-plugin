This plugin improves Vim's support for editing R code and makes it possible to integrate Vim with R. The functionality is similar to what you can find in Tinn-R and ESS mode of Emacs. This filetype plugin uses Tmux and the Screen plugin (Linux, OS X, or other Unix, vimscript #2711) or Python (Microsoft Windows) or Apple Script (Mac OS X) to communicate with R. The communication with R also depends on the R package vimcom.
