==============================================================================
							   *r-plugin-overview*
1. Overview~

This plugin improves Vim's support for editing R code and makes it possible to
integrate Vim with R.

It uses some ideas and code from Johannes Ranke's (vim-r-plugin), Eric Van
Dewoestine's (screen.vim plugin), Vincent Nijs (R.vim for Mac OS X) and some
ideas from the Tinn-R (Windows only) project.

The latest stable version of this plugin is available at:

    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628

Feedback is welcomed. Please submit bug reports and feature requests to the
developers, we are very interested in what you like and what you would like to
see in future releases. Do not like a feature? Tell us and we may add an
option to disable it. Cryptic error message are bugs... Please report them.
The plugin should emit useful warnings if you do things it was not programmed
to deal with.


==============================================================================
							   *r-plugin-features*
2. Main features~

  * Syntax highlighting for R code, including:
      - Special characters in strings.
      - Functions of all installed packages (must be updated manually).
      - Special highlighting for R output (.Rout files).
      - Spell check only strings and comments.
      - Fold code when foldmethod=syntax.
  * Syntax highlighting for RHelp syntax.
  * Smart indentation for R, RHelp and Rnoweb syntax.
  * Integrated communication with R:
      - Start/Close R.
      - Send lines, selection, paragraphs, functions, blocks, entire file.
      - Send commands with the object under cursor as argument: help, args,
	plot, print, str, summary, example, names.
      - Send to R the Sweave and pdflatex commands.
  * Omni completion (auto-completion) for R objects (.GlobalEnv and installed
    packages). The list of installed packages must be updated manually.
  * Auto-completion of function arguments.
  * Ability to see R's documentation in a Vim's buffer:
      - Automatic calculation of the best layout of the R documentation buffer
	(split the window either horizontally or vertically according to the
	available room).
      - Automatic formating of the text to fit the panel width.
      - Send code and commands to R (useful to run examples).
      - Jump to another R documentation.
      - Syntax highlighting of R documentation.
  * Object Browser (.GlobalEnv and loaded packages):
      - Send commands with the object under cursor as argument.
      - Call R's help() with the object under cursor as argument.
      - Syntax highlighting of the Object Browser.
  * Most of the plugin's behavior is customizable.

						       *r-plugin-installation*
3. Installation~

The installation instructions are split in four sections: (1) general
instructions for all operating systems; (2) instructions that are specific for
either Unix/Linux/OSX or Windows; (3) troubleshooting; and (4) optional steps.

3.1. General instructions I~

Note: Most of the plugin commands require that you type the <LocalLeader>
which is '\' by default.

You need to activate plugins and indentation according to 'filetype'. You
should have at least the following options in your |vimrc|:
>
   set nocompatible
   syntax enable
   filetype plugin on
   filetype indent on
<
Make a backup of your ~/.vim directory because existing files will be
replaced. Please, look at |r-plugin-files| to see the list of files.

3.2. Operating system specific instructions~

3.2.1. Unix (Linux, OS X, etc.)~

Uncompress the archive:
>
   unzip vim-r-plugin-*.zip -d ~/.vim
<
Start Vim and build the tags file for this document (and others that eventually
are in the same directory):
>
  :helptags ~/.vim/doc
<
Note: If you are using Mac OS X and prefer that Vim uses AppleScript to send
commands to R, then the installation is finished and you should now read
sections 3.3 and 3.4.

In addition to having R installed in your system, this plugin has the
following dependencies:

   Depends:~
   Vim >= 7.3 with Python support.
   Tmux >= 1.5:     http://tmux.sourceforge.net
   Screen plugin:   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2711
   vimcom >= 0.9-2: An R package.

   Recommends:~
   ncurses-term:  http://invisible-island.net/ncurses
   colorout:      An R package.
   setwidth:      An R package.

   Note: Tmux and ncurses-term are already packaged for most GNU/Linux
   distributions and other Unix variants. The library ncurses-term is
   necessary only for 256 color support in the terminal emulator.
   Unfortunately their installation instructions vary widely and are beyond
   the scope of this documentation.
   
   The vimcom package creates a server on R to allow the communication with
   Vim, the colorout package colorizes the R output and the setwidth package
   adjusts the value of options("width") whenever the terminal is resized.
   They can be installed from within R:
>
   install.packages(c("vimcom", "colorout", "setwidth"))
<
   You certainly will want to put something like the following in your
   ~/.Rprofile:
>
   if(interactive()){
       library(colorout)
       library(setwidth)
       library(vimcom)
   }
<
The plugin will run R inside a Tmux session. If you are using Vim (not GVim),
you may be interested in reading |r-plugin-tmux| section to learn a few useful
shortcuts. The tmux.conf file created by the plugin sets Tmux to work with Vi
key bindings, <C-a> as the escape character and also enables the mouse for
Tmux.

Note: The plugin can use different mechanisms to send commands to R. The
mechanism that will be used depends on both what applications and plugins you
have installed and what options you have in your |vimrc|. The two lists below
show how the plugin will work on Linux in different conditions:

   Vim                               Condition~
   ------------------------------    -------------------------------------
   Screen plugin (Tmux)              default on Linux 
   Screen plugin (GNU Screen)        vimrplugin_tmux = 0 or Tmux not found
   Tmux (external terminal)          vimrplugin_screenplugin = 0
   GNU Screen (external terminal)    vimrplugin_screenplugin = 0 and no Tmux


   GVim                              Condition~
   ------------------------------    -------------------------------------
   Tmux (external terminal)          default on Linux
   GNU Screen (external terminal)    vimrplugin_tmux = 0 or Tmux not found


Note: On Mac OS X the plugin will use AppleScript in both Vim and GVim unless
vimrplugin_applescript = 0.


3.2.2. Windows~

In addition to having R installed in your system, this plugin requires users
to install external dependencies:

    * Vim's version must be >= 7.3

    * Python: http://www.python.org/download/

      Note: The official Vim is 32 bit and, thus, Python must be 32 bit too.
      However, Vim and R run as independent processes, that is, you may have
      32 bit Vim sending commands to 64 bit R.

      Note: Be careful to download the correct Python version because Vim
	    needs a specific version of Python DLL. For example, the official
	    Vim 7.3 for Windows needs either Python 2.7 or 3.1. If Python was
	    not installed or was not found, the Vim-R-plugin will output
	    information about what Python version Vim was compiled against. Do
	    the following if you want to discover this information manually:

	    1. Type  :version  in Vim (normal mode).

	    2. Look for a string like -DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL="python27.dll".

	    3. Install the Python version which corresponds to the version
	       which Vim was linked against. In the example of step 2
	       (python27.dll) the required Python version is 2.7.x.
      
    * pywin32: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

      Note: The default download may not match the Python version Vim was
      linked against. You have to "View all files" on the download page to
      find the file that matches exactly the version of Python that you
      installed.

    * vimcom >= 0.9-2: An R package. You can install it with the R command
      install.packages("vimcom"). The vimcom package creates a server on R to
      allow the communication with Vim. You certainly will want to put
      the following lines in your Rprofile (usually at ~/Documents/.Rprofile):
>
      if(interactive()){
	  library(vimcom)
      }
<
Create your |vimfiles| directory if you do not have it yet. Its path will be
similar to one of the following:
>
  C:\Documents and Settings\yourlogin\vimfiles
  C:\Users\yourlogin\vimfiles
<
Uncompress the archive. Right click on the plugin's zip file and choose
"Extract all". Then choose ~/vimfiles as the destination directory.

Start Vim and build the tags file for this document (and others that eventually
are in the same directory):
>
  :helptags ~\vimfiles\doc
<
Start editing an R file with GVim and try to send some lines to R Console. You
may have to adjust the value of |vimrplugin_sleeptime|.


3.3. Troubleshooting (if the plugin doesn't work)~

Note: The <LocalLeader> is '\' by default.

The plugin is a |file-type| plugin. It will be active only if you are editing
a .R or .Rnw file. The menu items and tool bar buttons will not be visible and
the key bindings will not be active while editing either unnamed files or
files with name extensions other than .R or .Rnw. If the plugin is active,
pressing <LocalLeader>rf should start R.

Look at the ~/.vim (Linux, Unix, OS X) or ~/vimfiles (Windows) directory. Is
there a subdirectory named "r-plugin"? If not, then you unpacked the plugin in
the wrong place.

Did you see warning messages but they disappeared before you have had time to
read them? Type the command |:messages| in Normal mode to see them again.

Are you using Debian, Ubuntu or other Debian based Linux distribution? If yes,
you may prefer to install the Debian package available at:

   http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/vim-r-plugin.html


3.4. General instructions II (optional steps)~

3.4.1 Update list of objects~

Start R and update the list of objects for omni completion and syntax
highlight (see |:RUpdateObjList| for details).


3.4.2 Customize the plugin~

Please, read the section |r-plugin-options|. Emacs/ESS users should read the
section Indenting setup (|r-plugin-indenting|) of this document.


3.4.3 Hide unused buttons~

Edit GVim's toolbar and remove the buttons that you never use. The plugin adds
some buttons to the toolbar, but you may not see them because GVim has too
many buttons by default. Please see the page below to know how to hide buttons
on the toolbar:

   http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Hide_toolbar_or_menus_to_see_more_text


3.4.4 Install additional plugins~

You may be interested in installing additional general plugins to get
functionality not provided by this file type plugin. ShowMarks and snipMate
are particularly interesting. Please read |r-plugin-tips| for details.


==============================================================================
								*r-plugin-use*
4. Use~

4.1. Key bindings~

Note: The <LocalLeader> is '\' by default.

Note: It is recommended the use of different keys for <Leader> and
<LocalLeader> to avoid clashes between filetype plugins and general plugins
key binds. See |filetype-plugins| and |maplocalleader|.

To use the plugin, open a .R or .Rnw or .Rd file with Vim and type
<LocalLeader>rf. Then, you will be able to use the plugin key bindings to send
commands to R.

This plugin has many key bindings, which correspond with menu entries and, in
some cases, toolbar buttons. In the list below, the backslash represents the
<LocalLeader>. Not all menu items and key bindings are
enabled in all filetypes supported by the plugin (r, rnoweb, rhelp):

-----------------------------------------------------------

Please see |r-plugin-key-bindings| to learn how to customize the key bindings
without editing the plugin directly. 

After the command <LocalLeader>ao, Vim will save the current buffer if it has
any pending changes, run "R CMD BATCH --no-restore --no-save" on the current
file and show the resulting .Rout file in a new tab. Please see
|vimrplugin_routnotab| if you prefer that the file is open in a new split
window. Note: The command <LocalLeader>ao, silently writes the current buffer
to its file if it was modified and deletes the .Rout file if it exists.

R syntax uses " <- " to assign values to variables which is inconvenient to
type. In insert mode, typing a single underscore, "_", will write " <- ",
unless you are typing inside a string. The replacement will always happen if
syntax highlighting is off (see |:syn-on| and |:syn-off|). If necessary, it is
possible to insert an actual underscore into your file by typing a second
underscore. This behavior is similar to the EMACS ESS mode some users may be
familiar with and is enabled by default. You have to change the value of
|vimrplugin_underscore| to disable underscore replacement.

When you press <LocalLeader>rh, the plugin shows the help for the function
under the cursor. The plugin also checks the class of the object passed as
argument to the function to try to figure out whether the function is a
generic one and whether it is more appropriate to show a specific method. The
same procedure is followed with <LocalLeader>rp, that is, while printing an
object. For example, if you run the code below and, then, press
<LocalLeader>rh and <LocalLeader>rp over the two occurrences of summary, the
plugin will show different documentations and print different objects in each
case:
>
   y <- rnorm(100)
   x <- rnorm(100)
   m <- lm(y ~ x)
   summary(x)
   summary(m)
<
When completing object names (CTRL-X CTRL-O) and function arguments (CTRL-X
CTRL-A) you have to press CTRL-N to go foward in the list and CTRL-P to go
backward (see |popupmenu-completion|). Note: if using Vim in a terminal
emulator, Tmux will capture the CTRL-A command. You have to do CTRL-A twice to
pass a single CTRL-A to Vim.

If R is not running or if it is running but is busy the completion will be
based on information saved with the command |:RUpdateObjList|. Otherwise, the
pop up menu for completion of function arguments will include an additional
line with the name of the library where the function is (if the function name
can be found in more than one library) and the function method (if what is
being shown are the arguments of a method and not of the function itself).

To get help on an R topic, type in Vim (Normal mode):
>
   :Rhelp topic
<
The command may be abbreviated to  :Rh  and you can either press <Tab> to
trigger the autocompletion of R objects names or hit CTRL-D to list the
possible completions (see |cmdline-completion| for details on the various ways
of getting command-line completion). The list of objects used for
completion is the same one built by |:RUpdateObjList|.

You can source all .R files in a directory with the Normal mode command
:RSourceDir, which accepts an optional argument (the directory to be sourced).


4.2. Edition of rnoweb files~

In Rnoweb files (.Rnw), when the cursor is over the "@" character, which
finishes an R chunk, the sending of all commands to R is suspended and the
shortcut to send the current line makes the cursor to jump to the next chunk.
While editing rnoweb files, the following commands are available in Normal
mode:

   [count]gn : go to the next chunk of R code
   [count]gN : go to the previous chunk of R code


4.3. Omni completion and the highlighting of functions~
							     *:RUpdateObjList*
The plugin adds some features to the default syntax highlight of R code. One
such feature is the highlight of R functions. However, only functions that
R loads by default are highlighted. To add functions of other libraries, you
should do the following:

  1. Start R from within Vim.
  2. Use R's library() to load the libraries whose functions you want
     highlighted.
  3. Run the following command in Vim's Normal mode:
     :RUpdateObjList

The command :RUpdateObjList in addition to creating a list of function names
to be highlighted also creates a file containing a list of objects for omni
completion (|compl-omni|) including all objects currently in R's workspace,
with the exception of the .GlobalEnv objects. These two lists are stored
permanently in the ~/.vim/r-plugin directory.

The command  :RUpdateObjList  waits 60 seconds to R finish building the list.
If this time is not enough to your system, please, set a different value of
|vimrplugin_buildwait|.

You should run  :RUpdateObjList  whenever you upgrade R since some functions
are removed and new ones are added at each new R version.

Note: If you have too many loaded packages Vim may be unable to load the list
of functions for syntax highlight.


4.4. Omni completion~

Vim can automatically complete the names of R objects when CTRL-X CTRL-O is
pressed in insert mode (see |omni-completion| for details and 'completeopt' to
know how to customize the |omni-completion|). Omni completion shows in a pop
up menu the name of the object, its class and its environment (most
frequently, its package name). If the object is a function, its arguments are
shown in a separate window.

If a data.frame is found, while building the list of objects, the columns in
the data.frame are added to the list. When you try to use omni completion to
complete the name of a data.frame, the columns are not shown. But when the
data.frame name is already complete, and you have inserted the '$' symbol,
omni completion will show the column names.

Vim uses two files: one for the objects of .GlobalEnv and the other for all
other objects. The .GlobalEnv list is stored in the /tmp/r-plugin-yourlogin
directory and, thus, is deleted after each reboot. The other file is stored in
~/.vim/r-plugin and remains available until you manually rebuild it with the
command: |:RUpdateObjList|.


4.5. The Object Browser~

You have to do <LocalLeader>ro to either start or updated the Object Browser.
The updating is automatic only if the Object Browser is running in a separate
Tmux panel. The Object Browser has two views: .GlobalEnv and Libraries. If you
either press <Enter> or double click (GVim or Vim with 'mouse' set to "a") on
the first line of the Object Browser it will toggle the view between the
objects in .GlobalEnv and the currently loaded libraries (but only libraries
loaded when |:RUpdateObjList| was run will be shown).

In the .GlobalEnv view, if an object has the attribute "label", it will also
be displayed. Please, see the R help for package vimcom for some options to
control the Object Browser behavior. In the Object Browser window, while in
Normal mode, you can either press <Enter> or double click (GVim only) over a
data.frame or list to show/hide its elements (not if viewing the content of
loaded libraries). If you are running R in an environment where the string
UTF-8 is part of either LC_MESSAGES or LC_ALL variables, unicode line drawing
characters will be used to draw lines in the Object Browser. This is the case
of most Linux distributions.

In the Libraries view, you can either double click or press <Enter> over a
library to see its objects. In the Object Browser, the libraries have the
color defined by the PreProc highlighting group, and the other objects have
their colors defined by the return value of some R functions. Each line in the
table below shows a highlighting group and the corresponding R function (if
any) used to classify the objects:

	 PreProc	libraries
	 Number		is.numeric()
	 String		is.character()
	 Special	is.factor()
	 Boolean	is.logical()
	 Type		is.list()
	 Function	is.function()
	 Statement	isS4()

When running in a terminal emulator under Tmux, the Object Browser will be
updated automatically. One limitation is that objects made available by the
command data() may not have their classes recognized in the GlobalEnv view.
Also, when running under Tmux, the Normal mode command  d  deletes the object
on the cursor line or the element of a list or data.frame. If the Object
Browser is showing the libraries, the library currently on the cursor line is
detached. The Object Browser may stop to be updated automatically for a few
seconds if you press  d  many times quickly. Please, use a value greater than
250 to set the time in milliseconds that the Object Browser should wait for R
message that the object was already deleted (see |vimrplugin_ob_sleep|).


4.6. Commenting and uncommenting lines~

You can toggle the state of a line as either commented or uncommented by
typing <LocalLeader>xx.

You can also add comments to the right of a line with the <LocalLeader>;
shortcut. By default, the comment starts at the 40th column, which can be
changed by setting the value of r_indent_comment_column, as below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 20
<
If the line is longer than 38 characters, the comment will start two columns
after the last character in the line. If you are running <LocalLeader>; over a
selection of lines, the comments will be aligned according to the longest
line.


4.7. Build a tags file to jump to function definitions~
								 *:RBuildTags*
Vim can jump to functions defined in other files if you press CTRL-] over the
name of a function, but it needs a tags file to be able to find the function
definition (see |tags-and-searches|). The command  :RBuildTags  calls the R
function rtags() to build the tags file for the R scripts in the current
directory. Please read |r-plugin-tagsfile| to learn how to create a tags file
referencing source code located in other directories, including the entire R
source code.


4.8. Tmux usage~
							       *r-plugin-tmux*
When running Vim in a terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only), the Vim-R-plugin
will use the screen.vim plugin to restart Vim and start R in a Tmux session.
The Tmux configuration file provided by the Vim-R-plugin configures Tmux to
use vi key bindings. It also configures Tmux to react to mouse clicks. You
should be able to switch the active pane by clicking on an inactive pane, to
resize the panes by clicking on the border line and dragging it, and to scroll
the R Console with the mouse wheel. When you use the mouse wheel, Tmux enters
in its copy/scroll back mode (see below).

The configuration script also sets <C-a> as the Tmux scape character (the
default is <C-b>), that is, you have to type <C-a> before typing a Tmux
command. Below are the most useful key bindings to use Tmux with the tmux.conf
created by the Vim-R-plugin (see |vimrplugin_notmuxconf| if you prefer to use
your own ~/.tmux.conf)

    <C-a>arrow keys : Move the cursor to the Tmux panel above, below, at the
                      right or at the left of the current one.

    <C-a><C-Up>     : Move the panel division upward one line, that is, resize
		      the panels. Repeat <C-Up> to move more. <C-Down> will
		      move the division downward one line. If you are using
		      the vertical split, you should use <C-Left> and
		      <C-Right> to resize the panels.

    <C-a>[          : Enter the copy/scroll back mode. You can use <PgUp>,
		      <PgDown> and vi key bindings to move the cursor around
		      the panel. Press q to quit copy mode.
    <C-a>]          : Paste the content of Tmux paste buffer.

While in the copy and scroll back mode, the following key bindings are very
useful:

    q               : Quit the copy and scroll mode.
    <Space>         : Start text selection.
    v<Space>        : Start rectangular text selection.
    <Enter>         : Copy the selection to Tmux paste buffer.

Please, read the manual page of Tmux if you want to change the Tmux
configuration and learn more commands. To read the Tmux manual, type in the
terminal emulator:
>
  man tmux
>
Note: <C-a> was configured as the Tmux scape character, and it will not be
passed to applications running under Tmux. To send <C-a> to either R or Vim
you have to type <C-a>a.

With Tmux, you can the detach the Vim-R session and reattach it latter. This
is useful if you plan to begin the use the Vim-R-plugin in a machine and
latter move to another computer. However, normally you will get |E325|, caused
by the presence of a 'swapfile' (please, read the screen.vim plugin
documentation, especially the section |screen-gotchas| for details). This
problem will not happen if you start Vim from within a Tmux session, as in the
example below.

A sample detachable session could be:

  - Create your ~/.tmux.conf if it does not exist yet. You may put the lines
    below in your ~/.tmux.conf as a starting point to your own configuration
    file:
>
    set-option -g prefix C-a
    unbind-key C-b
    bind-key C-a send-prefix
    set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
    set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'
    set -g mode-mouse on
    set -g mouse-select-pane on
    set -g mouse-resize-pane on
<
  - Start Tmux:
      tmux

  - Start Vim:
      vim theScript.R

  - Use Vim to start an R session:
      <LocalLeader>rf

  - Send code from Vim to R, and, then, detach Vim and R with <C-a>d
    The command will be <C-b>d if you have not set <C-a> as the scape
    character in your ~/.tmux.conf.

  - Some time latter (even if accessing the machine remotely) reattach the
    Tmux session:
      tmux attach


4.9. GNU Screen usage~
							     *r-plugin-screen*
When running Vim in a terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only), the Vim-R-plugin
will use the screen.vim plugin to restart Vim and start R in a Tmux session.
However, the plugin will use GNU Screen if Tmux is not installed or if you
have set the value of vimrplugin_tmux = 0 in your |vimrc|.

You may want to create your own ~/.screenrc to customize GNU Screen behavior
(see |vimrplugin_noscreenrc|). Below are the most useful key bindings to use
the Vim-R-plugin with the screenrc that the plugin creates:

    <C-Tab>    : Move the cursor to the next panel.
    <C-a>a     : Decrease the height of the current panel.
    <C-a>z     : Increase the height of the current panel.
    <C-a>[     : Enter the copy/scroll back mode. You can use <PgUp>,
		 <PgDown> and vi key bindings to move the cursor around
		 the panel. Press q to quit copy mode.
    <C-a>]     : Paste the content of GNU Screen paste buffer.

While in the copy and scroll back mode, the following key bindings are very
useful:

    q          : Quit the copy and scroll mode.
    <Space>    : Start text selection.
    <Enter>    : Copy the selection to GNU Screen paste buffer.


==============================================================================
							 *r-plugin-known-bugs*
5. Known bugs and workarounds~

5.1. The Object Browser segfaults (Linux/Unix only)~

If the Vim instance running the Object Browser crashes you may want to close
all Vim instances and kill any Vim wandering around with the command (typed in
a terminal emulator):
>
   killall -9 vim
<

5.2. R's source() issues~

The R's source() function prints an extra new line between commands if the
option echo = TRUE, and error messages and warning are printed only after the
entire code is sourced, which makes it more difficult to find errors in the
code sent to R.


5.3. The clipboard's content is lost (Windows only)~

On Windows, the plugin copies the command that will be sent to R into the
clipboard. Thus, if you have anything in the clipboard it will be lost while
using the plugin.


5.4. The buffer name must be in the window title (Windows only)~

On Windows the plugin tries to activate the "R Console" window, paste the
command that is being sent to R, and, then, activate the GVim window. To
activate the GVim window the plugin requires that the name of the file being
edited be in the GVim window title. This is the default if you have not set
the option 'titlestring'.


5.5. The menu may not reflect some of your custom key bindings~

If you have created a custom key binding for the Vim-R-plugin, the menu in
GVim will not always reflect the correct key binding if it is not the same for
Normal, Visual and Insert modes.


5.6. Syntactically correct code may be wrongly indented~

If the Vim-R-plugin indents your code wrongly you may get the correct
indentation by adding braces and line breaks to it. Example:
>
    # This code will be wrongly indented

    levels(x) <- ## nl == nL or 1
        if (nl == nL) as.character(labels)
        else paste(labels, seq_along(levels), sep = "")
    class(x) <- c(if(ordered) "ordered", "factor")


    # But this one will be correctly indented

    levels(x) <- ## nl == nL or 1
	if (nl == nL)
	    as.character(labels)
	else
	    paste(labels, seq_along(levels), sep = "")
    class(x) <- c(if(ordered) "ordered", "factor")
<

5.7. Commands are sent twice on Mac OS X~

If you use the screen plugin with GNU Screen, individual lines may be sent
duplicated to R on Mac OS X.


5.8. [Errno 98] Address already in use~

When deleting objects using the "d" command in the Object Browser, the message
"[Errno 98] Address already in use" may appear. In this case, the Object
Browser will not work properly until you stop using it and wait for the time
set in 'updatetime' (four seconds, by default). Then, the Object Browser
should be normal again. The "d" command is available only when running R on
Tmux.

6.1. Terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only)~
							     *vimrplugin_term*
The plugin uses the first terminal emulator that it finds in the following
list:
    1. gnome-terminal, 
    2. konsole, 
    3. xfce4-terminal, 
    4. iterm
    5. Eterm, 
    6. rxvt, 
    7. aterm, 
    8. roxterm,
    9. terminator,
   10. xterm.

If Vim does not select your favorite terminal emulator, you may define it in 
your |vimrc| by setting the variable vimrplugin_term, as shown below:
>
   let vimrplugin_term = "xterm"
<
							 *vimrplugin_term_cmd*
If your terminal emulator is not listed above, or if you are not satisfied
with the way your terminal emulator is called by the plugin, you may define in
your |vimrc| the variable vimrplugin_term_cmd, as in the examples below:
>
   let vimrplugin_term_cmd = "gnome-terminal --title R -e"
   let vimrplugin_term_cmd = "terminator --title R -x"
   let vimrplugin_term_cmd = "/Applications/Utilities/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm -t R"
<
Please, look at the manual of your terminal emulator to know how to call it.
The last argument must be the one which precedes the command to be executed.


6.2. Underscore and Rnoweb completion of code block~
						       *vimrplugin_underscore*
						      *vimrplugin_rnowebchunk*
While editing R code, '_' is replaced with ' <- '. To disable this feature,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_underscore = 0
<
In Rnoweb files, a '<' is replaced with '<<>>=\n@'. To disable this feature,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_rnowebchunk = 0
<

6.3. Object Browser options~
						      *vimrplugin_objbr_place*
							  *vimrplugin_objbr_w*
						      *vimrplugin_external_ob*
By default, the object browser will be created with 40 columns. The minimum
width of the Object Browser window is 9 columns. You can change the object
browser's default width by setting the value of |vimrplugin_objbr_w| in your
|vimrc|, as below:
>
   let vimrplugin_objbr_w = 30
<
The Object Browser will always be created by splitting the Vim script window
if you are running GVim. However, if running Vim in a terminal emulator, the
Object Browser will be created in a independent Vim instance in a Tmux panel
beside the R Console. Valid values for the Object Browser placement are
"script" or "console" and "right" or "left". Examples:
>
   let vimrplugin_objbr_place = "script,right"
   let vimrplugin_objbr_place = "console,left"
<
If vimrplugin_external_ob = 1 and R is running in an external terminal
emulator and the communication with R is being established through Tmux, the
Object Browser will be placed besides the R Console in the external terminal
emulator. In this case, the command \rh will not work on the Object Browser.

When deleting an object from the Object Browser (possible if running Vim under
Tmux), the following option controls the time in milliseconds that the Object
Browser will wait for R to send the message updating the list of objects:
>
   let vimrplugin_ob_sleep = 250m
<
You should increase this value if the "[Errno 98]" message appears frequently.


6.4. Vim as pager for R help~
							 *vimrplugin_vimpager*
							 *vimrplugin_editor_w*
							   *vimrplugin_help_w*
6.4.1. Quick setup~

If you do not want to see R documentation in a Vim's buffer, put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_vimpager = "no"
<
If you want to use Vim to see R documentation even when looking for help in
the R console, put in your .Rprofile:
>
   options(pager = "vim -c 'set ft=rdoc' -")
<

6.4.2. Details and other options:~

The plugin key bindings will remain active in the documentation buffer, and,
thus, you will be able to send commands to R as you do while editing an R
script. You can, for example, use <LocalLeader>rh to jump to another R help
document.

The valid values of vimrplugin_vimpager are:
   
   "tab"       : Show the help document in a new tab. If there is already a
                 tab with an R help document, use it.
		 This is the default.
   "vertical"  : Split the window vertically if the editor width is large
		 enough; otherwise, split the window horizontally and attempt
		 to set the window height to at least 20 lines.
   "horizontal": Split the window horizontally.
   "tabnew"    : Show the help document in a new tab.
   "no"        : Do not show R documentation in Vim.

The window will be considered large enough if it has more columns than
vimrplugin_editor_w + vimrplugin_help_w. These variables control the minimum
width of the editor window and the help window, and their default values are,
respectively, 66 and 46. Thus, if you want to have more control over Vim's
behavior while opening R's documentations, you will want to set different
values to some variables in your |vimrc|, as in the example:
>
   let vimrplugin_editor_w = 80
   let vimrplugin_editor_h = 60
<

6.5. Number of R processes (Linux/Unix only)~
							*vimrplugin_nosingler*
						  *vimrplugin_by_vim_instance*
6.5.1 Using (G)Vim without the screen.vim plugin~

By default, all buffers of all (G)Vim instances send code to the same R process.
If you prefer that each Vim buffer uses its own R process, put the following
option in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_nosingler = 1
<
If you prefer that each Vim instance calls its own R process and all of the
instance's buffers send code to this R process while other Vim instances send
code to other R processes then put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_by_vim_instance = 1
>
The |vimrplugin_by_vim_instance| option requires that Vim is acting as a
command server because the variable |v:servername| is used to make the name of
the Tmux session which will run R. By default, GVim runs as server, but Vim
does not. Hence, if you are using Vim you have either to start Vim with the
argument --servername or use the screen.vim plugin which tries to restart Vim
with the --servername argument. If you want to use more than nine GVim
instances you will have to use the --servername argument because screen will
not differentiate between names like "GVIM1" and "GVIM10".

6.5.2 Using the screen.vim plugin~

Both options are ignored when using Vim in a terminal emulator and using the
screen.vim plugin. The plugin behaves as if the |vimrplugin_by_instance| was
enabled.


6.6. Use 32 bit version of R (Windows and Mac OS X only)~
							     *vimrplugin_i386*
If you are using a 64 bit Windows or a 64 bit Mac OS X, but prefer to run the
32 bit version of R, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_i386 = 1
<

6.7. R path~
							   *vimrplugin_r_path*
Vim will run the first R executable in the path. You can set an alternative R
path in your |vimrc| as in the examples:
>
   let vimrplugin_r_path = "/path/2/my/preferred/R/version/bin"
   let vimrplugin_r_path = "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.12.0\\i386\\bin"
>
On Windows, Vim will try to find the R install path in the Windows Registry.


6.8. Arguments to R~
							   *vimrplugin_r_args*
Set this option in your |vimrc| if you want to pass command line arguments to
R at the startup. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_r_args = "--sdi --no-save --quiet"
<
On Linux, there is no default value for |vimrplugin_r_args|. On Windows, the
default value is "--sdi", but you may change it to "--mdi" if you do not like
the SDI style of the graphical user interface.


6.9. Time necessary to build list of objects for omni completion~
							*vimrplugin_buildwait*
If your system needs more than 60 seconds to build the list of objects for
omni completion after you do the command |:RUpdateObjList|, then you should
set the value of |vimrplugin_buildwait| to a higher value. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_buildwait = 240
>

6.10. More colorful syntax highlight of .Rout files~
						   *vimrplugin_routmorecolors*
By default, the R commands in .Rout files are highlighted with the color of
comments, and only the output of commands has some of its elements highlighted
(numbers, strings, index of vectors, warnings and errors). 

If you prefer that R commands in the R output are highlighted as they are in R
scripts, put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_routmorecolors = 1
<

6.11. How to automatically open the .Rout file~
							*vimrplugin_routnotab*
After the command <LocalLeader>ao, Vim will save the current buffer if it has
any pending changes, run "R CMD BATCH --no-restore --no-save" on the current
file and show the resulting .Rout file in a new tab. If you prefer that the
file is open in a new split window, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_routnotab = 1
<

6.12. Indent commented lines~
						 *vimrplugin_indent_commented*
You can type <LocalLeader>xx to comment out a line or selected lines. If the
line already starts with a comment string, it will be removed. After adding
the comment string, the line will be reindented by default. To turn off the
automatic indentation, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_indent_commented = 0
<
What string will be added to the beginning of the line depends on the values
of vimrplugin_indent_commented and r_indent_ess_comments according to the

6.13. Sleep time (Windows only)~
							*vimrplugin_sleeptime*
The plugin gives to R a small amount of time to process the paste command. The
default value is 0.2 second, but you should experiment different values. The
example show how to adjust the value of sleeptime in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_sleeptime = 0.1
<

6.14. Tmux and Screen configuration (Linux/Unix only)~
						       *vimrplugin_noscreenrc*
						       *vimrplugin_notmuxconf*
GVim (or Vim running R in an external terminal emulator) runs Tmux with a
specially built configuration file. It also overwrite the value of
|g:ScreenShellTmuxInitArgs|. If you want to use your own ~/.tmux.conf and
|g:ScreenShellTmuxInitArgs|, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_notmuxconf = 1
<
If you want to use your own ~/.screenrc, put in your vimrc:
>
   let vimrplugin_noscreenrc = 1
<

6.15. Integration with screen.vim plugin (Linux/Unix only)~
						     *vimrplugin_screenplugin*
						     *vimrplugin_screenvsplit*
							     *vimrplugin_tmux*
The screen.vim plugin supports both GNU Screen and Tmux, but only Tmux allows
you to split the terminal vertically (that is, to have the panels side by
side). Also, the automatic updating of the Object Browser is enabled only when
running R in a Tmux session. Please read |screen-intro| and
|screen-shell-vertical| for details. By default, the Vim-R-plugin will tell
the screen.vim plugin to split the terminal horizontally. If you prefer to
split it vertically put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_screenvsplit = 1
   let g:ScreenImpl = 'Tmux'
<
By default, when running in a terminal emulator, the Vim-R-plugin uses the
screen.vim plugin if it is installed and, by default, it will use Tmux instead
of GNU Screen. Tmux was chosen as default because it may split the terminal
vertically and its regions are easier to resize. If you want that the R
Console starts with a specific width, put in your |vimrc| your preferred value:
>
   let g:ScreenShellWidth = 80
<
If both GNU Screen and Tmux are installed but you prefer to use the GNU Screen
application, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_tmux = 0
<
If Tmux is not installed, the Vim-R-plugin will use GNU Screen.

Start Vim and do the command <LocalLeader>rf. The screen.vim plugin will split
the terminal in two regions and will run R in one of them. Using both plugins
at the same time is especially useful for users who may prefer to use Vim and
R in a terminal emulator, rather than using the graphical interface provided
by GVim.

If you have the screen.vim plugin installed but prefer do not integrate it
with the Vim-R-plugin you will need to add the following to your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_screenplugin = 0
<

6.16. Integration with AppleScript (OS X only)~
							*vimrplugin_applescript*
In Mac OS X, the plugin will try to send commands to R gui using AppleScript
if running the GUI version of MacVim. If you prefer to have R running in an
external terminal emulator, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_applescript = 0
   let vimrplugin_screenplugin = 0
<

6.17. Special R functions~
						      *vimrplugin_listmethods*
						      *vimrplugin_specialplot*
The R function args() lists the arguments of a function, but not the arguments
of its methods. If you want that the plugin calls the function
.vim.list.args() after <LocalLeader>ra, you have to add to your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_listmethods = 1
<
By default, R makes a scatterplot of numeric vectors. The function .vim.plot()
do both a histogram and a boxplot. The function can be called by the plugin
after <LocalLeader>rg if you put the following line in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_specialplot = 1
<

6.18. maxdeparse~
						       *vimrplugin_maxdeparse*
You can set the argument maxdeparse to be passed to R's source() function.
Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_maxdeparse = 300
<

6.19. LaTeX command~
							 *vimrplugin_latexcmd*
						       *vimrplugin_sweaveargs*
							 *vimrplugin_knitargs*
By default, Vim calls pdflatex to produce a pdf document from the .tex file
produced by the R Sweave command. You can use the option vimrplugin_latexcmd
to change this behavior. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_latexcmd = "latex"
<
If you want to pass arguments do the Sweave() function, set the value of the
vimrplugin_sweaveargs variable.

If you want to pass arguments do the knit() function, set the value of the
vimrplugin_knitargs variable.


6.20. Never unmake the R menu and tool bar buttons~
						*vimrplugin_never_unmake_menu*
Use this option if you want that the menu item R and the R related tool bar
buttons are not deleted when you change from one buffer to another, for
example, when going from an .R file to a .txt one:
>
   let vimrplugin_never_unmake_menu = 1
<
When this options is enabled all menu items are created regardless of the file
type.


6.21. Map 'r'~
							    *vimrplugin_map_r*
If the variable |vimrplugin_map_r| exists, the plugin will map the letter 'r'
to send lines to R when there are visually selected lines, for compatibility
with the original plugin. To activate this option, insert the following into
|vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_map_r = 1
<
You may want to add the following three lines to your |vimrc| which were in
Johannes Ranke's plugin and will increase compatibility with code edited with
Emacs:
>
   set expandtab
   set shiftwidth=4
   set tabstop=8
<

6.22. Add ^A^K to the beginning of commands~
							    *vimrplugin_ca_ck*
When one types <C-a> in the R Console the cursor goes to the beginning of the
line and one types <C-k> the characters to the right of the cursor are
deleted. This is useful to avoid characters left on the R Console being mixed
with commands sent by Vim. However, sending <C-a> may be problematic if using
either Tmux or GNU Screen in some systems. The Vim-R-plugin will add
<C-a><C-k> to every command if you put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_ca_ck = 1
<

==============================================================================
						       *r-plugin-key-bindings*
7. Custom key bindings~

When creating custom key bindings for the Vim-R-plugin, it is necessary to
create three maps for most functions because the way the function is called is
different in each Vim mode. Thus, key bindings must be made for Normal mode,
insert mode, and visual mode.

To customize a key binding you should put in your |vimrc| something like:
>
   nmap <F2> <Plug>RStart
   imap <F2> <Plug>RStart
   vmap <F2> <Plug>RStart
<
The above example shows how to change key binding used to start R from
<LocalLeader>rf to <F2>.

Only the custom key bindings for Normal mode are shown in Vim's menu, but you
can type |:map| to see the complete list of current mappings, and below is the
list of the names for custom key bindings:
>
   RBibTeX                   RSendChunk               RObjectNames
   RClearAll                 RDSendChunk              RObjectPr
   RClearConsole             RESendChunk              RObjectStr
   RClose                    REDSendChunk             RPlot
   RCommentLine              RSendParagraph           RSPlot
   RCustomStart              RDSendParagraph          RSaveClose
   RSendFunction             RESendParagraph          RSetwd
   RDSendFunction            REDSendParagraph         RShowArgs
   RESendFunction            RSendSelection           RShowEx
   REDSendFunction           RDSendSelection          RShowRout
   RSendLine                 RESendSelection          RStart
   RDSendLine                REDSendSelection         RSummary
   RSendLAndOpenNewOne       RSendFile                RSweave
   RSendMBlock               RESendFile               RUpdateObjBrowser
   RDSendMBlock              RHelp                    RVanillaStart
   RESendMBlock              RListSpace               RCompleteArgs
   REDSendMBlock             RMakePDF
<
Note: The prefix RE means "echo"; RD, "cursor down"; RED, both "echo" and
      "down".

The completion of function arguments only happens in Insert mode. To customize
its keybind you should put in your |vimrc| something as in the example:
>
   imap <C-A> <Plug>RCompleteArgs
<
The plugin also contains a function called RAction which allows you to build
ad-hoc commands to R. This function takes the name of an R function such as
"levels" or "table" and the word under the cursor, and passes them to R as a
command. 

For example, if your cursor is sitting on top of the object called gender and
you call the RAction function, with an argument such as levels, Vim will pass
the command levels(gender) to R, which will show you the levels of the object
gender.

To make it even easier to use this function, you could write a custom key
binding that would allow you to rapidly get the levels of the object under
your cursor. Add the following to your |vimrc| to have an easy way to pass R
the levels command:
>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>rk :call RAction("levels")<CR>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>t :call RAction("tail")<CR>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>h :call RAction("head")<CR>
<
Then if you type <LocalLeader>rk R will receive the command
>
   levels(myObject)
<
You should replace <LocalLeader>rk with the key binding that you want to use
and "levels" with the R function that you want to call.

If the command that you want to send does not require an R object as argument,
you can create a shortcut to it by following the example:
>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>s :call SendCmdToR("search()")
<

==============================================================================
							       *r-plugin-tips*
9. FAQ and tips~

9.1. Is it possible to stop R from within Vim?~

Sorry, it is not possible. You have to press ^C into R's terminal emulator.


9.2. Html help and custom pager~

If you prefer to see help pages in an html browser, put in your ~/.Rprofile:
>
   options(help_type = "html")
<
and in your |vimrc| (see |vimrplugin_vimpager|):
>
   let vimrplugin_vimpager = "no"
<

9.3. How do marked blocks work?~
							  *r-plugin-showmarks*
Vim allows several marks (bookmarks). The most commonly used marks are the
lowercase alphabet letters. If the cursor is between any two marks, the plugin
will send the lines between them to R. If the cursor is above the first mark,
the plugin will send from the beginning of the file to the mark. If the cursor
is below the last mark, the plugin will send from the mark to the end of the
file. The mark above the cursor is included and the mark below is excluded
from the block to be sent to R. To create a mark, press m<letter> in Normal
mode.

We recommended the use of ShowMarks plugin which show what lines have marks
defined. The plugin is available at:

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=152
  
This plugin makes it possible to visually manage your marks. You may want to
add the following two lines to your |vimrc| to customize ShowMarks behavior:
>
   let marksCloseWhenSelected = 0
   let showmarks_include = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
<

9.4. Use snipMate~
							   *r-plugin-snippets*
You probably will want to use the snipMate plugin to insert snippets of code
in your R script. The plugin may be downloaded from:

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540

The snipMate plugin does not come with snippets for R, but you can copy the
r.snippets that ships with the Vim-R-plugin (look at the r-plugin directory)
to the snippets directory. The file has only a few snippets, but it will help
you to get started. If you usually edit rnoweb files, you may also want to
create an rnoweb.snippet by concatenating both tex.snippets and r.snippets.


9.5. Easier key bindings for most used commands~
							   *r-plugin-bindings*
The most used commands from Vim-R-plugin probably are "Send line" and "Send
selection". You may find it a good idea to map them to the space bar in your
|vimrc| (suggestion made by Iago Mosqueira):
>
   vmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendSelection
   nmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendLine
<
You may also want to remap <C-x><C-o>:

   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2269005/how-can-i-change-the-keybinding-used-to-autocomplete-in-vim


9.6. Remap the <LocalLeader>~
							*r-plugin-localleader*
People writing Rnoweb documents may find it better to use a comma or other key
as the <LocalLeader> instead of the default backslash (see |maplocalleader|):
>
   let maplocalleader = ","
<

9.7. Use a tags file to jump to function definitions~
							   *r-plugin-tagsfile*
Vim can jump to a function definition if it finds a "tags" file with the
information about the place where the function is defined. To generate the
tags file, use the R function rtags(), which will build an Emacs tags file.
If Vim was compiled with the feature |emacs_tags|, it will be able to read the
tags file. Otherwise, you can use the function etags2ctags() from the script
located at ~/.vim/r-plugin/etags2ctags.R to convert the Emacs tags file into a
Vim's one. To jump to a function definition, put the cursor over the function
name and hit CTRL-]. Please, read |tagsrch.txt| for details on how to use tags
files, specially the section |tags-option|.

You could, for example, download and unpack R's source code, start R inside
the ~/.vim directory and do the following command:
>
   rtags(path = "/path/to/R/source/code", recursive = TRUE, ofile = "RTAGS")
<
Then, you would quit R and do the following command in the terminal emulator:
>
   ctags --languages=C,Fortran,Java,Tcl -R -f RsrcTags /path/to/R/source/code
<
Finally, you would put the following in your |vimrc|, inside an |autocmd-group|:
>
   autocmd FileType r set tags+=~/.vim/RTAGS,~/.vim/RsrcTags
   autocmd FileType rnoweb set tags+=~/.vim/RTAGS,~/.vim/RsrcTags
<
Note: While defining the autocmd, the RTAGS path must be put before RsrcTags.

Example on how to test whether your setup is ok:

   1. Type "mapply()" in an R script and save the buffer.
   2. Press CTRL-] over "mapply" (Vim should jump to "mapply.R").
   3. Locate the string "do_mapply", which is the name of a C function.
   4. Press CTRL-] over "do_mapply" (Vim sould jump to "mapply.c").


9.8. Indenting setup~
							  *r-plugin-indenting*
Note: In Normal mode, type |==| to indent the current line and gg=G to format
the entire buffer (see |gg|, |=| and |G| for details). These are Vim commands;
they are not specific to R code.

The Vim-R-plugin includes a script to automatically indent R files. By
default, the script aligns function arguments if they span for multiple lines.
If you prefer do not have the arguments of functions aligned, put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_align_args = 0
<
By default, all lines beginning with a comment character, #, get the same
indentation level of the normal R code. Users of Emacs/ESS may be used to have
lines beginning with a single # indented in the 40th column, ## indented as R
code, and ### not indented. If you prefer that lines beginning with comment
characters are aligned as they are by Emacs/ESS, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_comments = 1
<
If you prefer that lines beginning with a single # are aligned at a column
different from the 40th one, you should set a new value to the variable
r_indent_comment_column, as in the example below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 30
<
By default any code after a line that ends with "<-" is indented. Emacs/ESS
does not indent the code if it is a top level function. If you prefer that the
Vim-R-plugin behaves like Emacs/ESS in this regard, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_compatible = 1
<
Below is an example of indentation with and without this option enabled:
>
   ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 1           ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 0
   foo <-                                    foo <-
       function(x)                               function(x)
   {                                             {
       paste(x)                                      paste(x)
   }                                             }
<
Notes: (1) Not all code indented by Emacs/ESS will be indented by the
	   Vim-R-plugin in the same way, and, in some circumstances it may be
	   necessary to make changes in the code to get it properly indented
	   by Vim (you may have to either put or remove braces and line
	   breaks).
       (2) Indenting is not a file type plugin option. It is a feature defined
           in indent/r.vim. That is why it is documented in this section.


9.9. Folding setup~
							    *r-plugin-folding*
Vim has several methods of folding text (see |fold-methods| and
|fold-commands|). To enable the syntax method of folding for R files, put in
your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_syntax_folding = 1
<
With the above option, Vim will load R files with all folds closed. If you
prefer to start editing files with all folds open, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   set nofoldenable
<
Notes: (1) Enabling folding may slow down Vim. (2) Folding is not a file type
plugin option. It is a feature defined in syntax/r.vim.

Note: Indentation of R code is very slow because the indentation algorithm
sometimes goes backwards looking for an opening parenthesis or brace or for
the beginning of a "for", "if" or "while" statement. This is necessary because
the indentation level of a given line depends on the indentation level of the
previous line, but the previous line is not always the line above. It's the
line where the statement immediately above started. Of course someone may
develop a better algorithm in the future.


9.10. Automatically close parenthesis~

Some people want Vim automatically inserting a closing parenthesis, bracket or
brace when an open one has being typed. The page below explains how to achieve
this goal:

   http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatically_append_closing_characters


9.11. Automatic line breaks~

By default, Vim breaks lines when you are typing if you reach the column
defined by the 'textwidth' option. If you prefer that Vim does not break the R
code automatically, breaking only comment lines, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   autocmd FileType r setlocal formatoptions=cq
<

9.12. Vim with 256 colors in a terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only)~

If you want 256 colors support in Vim, install the package ncurses-term. Then
put in your ~/.bashrc:
>
   if [ "x" != "x$DISPLAY" ]
   then
       if [ "screen" = "$TERM" ]
       then
           export TERM=screen-256color
       else
           export TERM=xterm-256color
       fi
   fi
<
Finally, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   if &term =~ "xterm" || &term =~ "256" || $DISPLAY != ""
       set t_Co=256
   endif
   colorscheme your_prefered_color_scheme
<
You have to search the internet for color schemes supporting 256 colors,
download and copy them to ~/.vim/colors. You may use the command
|:colorscheme| to try them all before setting your preference in your |vimrc|.


9.13. Run your Makefile from within R~

Do you have many Rnoweb files included in a master tex or Rnoweb file and use
a Makefile to build the pdf? You may consider it useful to put the following
line in your |vimrc|:
>
   nmap <LocalLeader>sm :update<CR>:call SendCmdToR('system("make")')<CR>
<

9.14. Group windows with compiz~

If you are using Compiz, it may be easier to work with the plugin if the
various related windows (editor, terminal, and graphics window) are grouped
because they will be raised together when one of them receives the focus.
You may need CompizConfig Settings Manager installed to enable this feature
(look at the "Window Management" section for "Group and Tab Windows").


9.15. Why do I have to updated the Object Browser manually?~

It is because Vim and R run as separate processes and, thus, it is not
possible to Vim to know whether R is busy or not. If R was running as part of
the text editor, as happens with RStudio, JGR, RKward, and others, which are
linked to libR.so, it would be possible to wait for R to finish processing a
command before sending to it a command to rebuild the list of objects for the
Object Browser. This command should be sent after each line sent to R. But if
the Vim-R-plugin did this, the use of Vim would be blocked until R finished
its processing. 


9.16. Edit your ~/.Rprofile~

You may want to edit your ~/.Rprofile. Two common options are the use of GVim
as the text editor and the use of Vim as pager. Example for Linux with these
two options and some others:
>
   if(interactive()){
       library(colorout)
       library(setwidth)
       options(vimcom.verbose = 1, vimcom.allnames = TRUE)
       if(Sys.getenv("VIMRPLUGIN_TMPDIR") != "")
	   library(vimcom)
       if(Sys.getenv("TERM") != "linux" && Sys.getenv("TERM") != "")
	   setOutputColors256(verbose = FALSE)
       if(nchar(Sys.getenv("DISPLAY")) > 1){
	   grDevices::X11.options(width = 4.5, height = 4, ypos = 0,
				  xpos = 1000, pointsize = 10)
	   options(editor = 'gvim -f -c "set ft=r"')
	   options(pager = "gvim -c 'set ft=rdoc' -")
       } else {
	   options(editor = 'vim -c "set ft=r"')
	   options(pager = "vim -c 'set ft=rdoc' -")
       }
   }
<
The test for the environment variable DISPLAY is useful if you eventually use
the plugin over ssh or on the Linux console.

The X11.options() is used to choose the position and dimensions of the X11
graphical device. You can also install the application wmctrl and create
shortcuts in your desktop environment to the commands
>
   wmctrl -r "R Graphics" -b add,above
   wmctrl -r "R Graphics" -b remove,above
<
which will toggle the "always on top" state of the X11 device window.
Alternatively, you can right click on the X11 device window title bar and
choose "Always on top". This is useful to emulate a feature present in R IDEs
which can display R plots in a separate panel. Although we can not embed an R
graphical device in Vim, we can at least make it always visible over the
terminal emulator or the GVim window.

An example for Windows:
>
   if (interactive()) {
     local({
       options(editor = '"C:/Program Files (x86)/Vim/vim73/gvim.exe" "-c" "set filetype=r"')
       options(help_type = "html")
     })
   }

9.17. Debugging R functions~

The Vim-R-Plugin does not have debugging facilities, but you may want to use
the R package "debug":
>
   install.packages("debug")
   library(debug)
   mtrace(function)
<
Once the library is installed and loaded, you should use mtrace(function_name)
to enable the debugging of a function. Then, the next time that the function
is called it will enter in debugging mode. Once debugging a function, you can
hit <Enter> to evaluate the current line, go(n) to go to line n in the
function and qqq() to quit the function (See debug's help for details). A
useful tip is to click on the title bar of the debug window and choose "Always
on top" or a similar option provided by your desktop manager.

There is also the R package "edtdbg" which aims to integrate R debugging
facilities with Vim.

9.18. Turn the R-plugin into a global plugin~
							     *r-plugin-global*
The Vim-R-plugin is a file type plugin. If you want its functionality
available for all file types, then go to your ~/.vim/plugin directory and
create a symbolic link to ~/.vim/r-plugin/global_r_plugin.vim. That is, type
the following in a terminal emulator:
>
   cd ~/.vim/plugin/
   ln -s ../r-plugin/global_r_plugin.vim
<
On Windows, you probably will have to make a copy of the file to the
~/vimfiles/plugin directory.


9.19. Disable syntax highlight of R functions~

If you want to disable the syntax highlight of R functions edit the file
~/.vim/r-plugin/functions.vim and delete all lines, but do not delete the
file.


9.20. Integration with the Conque Shell plugin~
							     *r-plugin-conque*
In addition to being integrated with the screen.vim plugin the Vim-R-plugin
can also use the Conque Shell plugin, but the Conque Shell still has some
important bugs and Vim has limitations that make the use of Conque Shell not
fully satisfying. The most important bug of Conque Shell is that it sometimes
do not show the complete output of an R command. This problem happens more
frequently when there are non ascii characters in the output. The two most
important Vim limitations are:

  - We cannot scroll the windows of a buffer that is not being edited and,
    thus, we have to go to the R buffer to scroll it. This is a problem if we
    are running an R command that slowly generates a lot of output because the
    shell buffer does not scroll when there is new output but it is not the
    currently active buffer.

  - Vim does not have a timer which would make the Conque Shell more
    efficient. Vim uses the same variable, 'updatetime', to do both save swap
    files and trigger |CursorHold| events.

These limitations will be solved only if someone with good knowledge of C
programming writes patches to Vim source code and the patches are accepted by
the Vim developer.

In addition to these two limitations, the automatic update of the Object
Browser only works when running Vim under Tmux. Anyway, if you want to try the
Conque Shell, install it from

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2771

do not load the R package "colorout", and put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_ca_ck = 0
   let vimrplugin_applescript = 0
   let vimrplugin_screenplugin = 0
   let vimrplugin_conqueplugin = 1
<
You may also want to put the following Conque options in your |vimrc| (look at
the Conque Shell documentations for details):
>
   let ConqueTerm_CWInsert = 1
   let ConqueTerm_Color = 0
   let ConqueTerm_ReadUnfocused = 1
<
By default, the window will be split horizontally. Put the following in your
|vimrc| if you prefer to split the window vertically:
>
   let vimrplugin_conquevsplit = 1
<
You may also need to change the time that the Conque Shell waits for R output.
After a command is sent to the Conque buffer, the Conque Shell plugin waits
100 milliseconds (on Linux) or 200 milliseconds (on Windows) before reading
R's output. Longer values for the waiting time will increase the chances that
the output of R commands will be immediately shown in the R Console. To set a
different waiting time, change the value of vimrplugin_conquesleep in your
|vimrc| as in the example:
>
   let vimrplugin_conquesleep = 300
<
To manually scroll the R Console buffer, put the following in your |vimrc|
(replace <F5> with your preferred key):
>
   nmap <F5> :call RScrollTerm()<CR>
<
Then, you will be able to scroll the R Console buffer at any time by pressing the
<F5> key in Normal mode. Of course, you should replace <F5> with your
preferred key.

With the Conque Shell, the option |vimrplugin_nosingler| is ignored, and, by
default, the object browser window will be created at the right of the R
Console window.

The same highlighting scheme used for .Rout files is applied to the R Console
when using the Conque Shell plugin to run R inside a Vim's buffer. For one
hand, we do not need to highlight R commands in the Console if they were sent
by the plugin from an R script buffer since we have the code highlighted in
the script buffer and in the Console we want to pay attention to the output. A
too colorful highlighting scheme would be distracting. On the other hand, if
we were typing commands directly in the Console it would be beneficial to have
the R syntax highlighted.
